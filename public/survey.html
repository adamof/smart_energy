        <h2>Smart meter web application evaluation.</h2>
        <h4>Hello and thank you for taking the time to help me with my honours project!</h4>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          As part of my honours project I have developed a software which provides the same functionality as the meters that will be going into homes and it will be used as part of a major project - <a href="http://www.energyoracle.org/">IDEAL project</a> at the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>. This project will focus on examining the effect of providing personalised behavioural feedback to occupants: explicitly identifying the behaviours (e.g., showering and bathing, room heating, major appliance use) that account for energy use/expenditure; and how these could be reduced.
        </p>
        <h4>My project</h4>
        <p>
          As mentioned above, this web application is supposed to mimic the functionality provided by the smart meters that will be installed as part of the Smart Meter programme. That functionality includes displaying information about the energy(gas and electricity) usage such as: 
          <ul>
            <li>energy usage</li>
            <li>energy cost</li>
            <li>carbon footprint</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <a href="households/40/gas_usage">Proceed to evaluation.</a>
