        <h2>Smart meter web application evaluation.</h2>
        <h4>Hello and thank you for taking the time to help me with my honours project!</h4>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          As part of my honours project I have developed some software which provides the same functionality as the meters that will be going into homes and it will used as part of a future project - <a href="http://www.energyoracle.org/">IDEAL project</a> at the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>. This project will focus on examining the effect of providing personalised behavioural feedback to occupants: explicitly identifying the behaviours (e.g., showering and bathing, room heating, major appliance use) that account for energy use/expenditure; and how these could be reduced.
        </p>
        <h4>My project</h4>
        <p>
          As mentioned above this web applications is supposed to mimic the functionality provided by the smart meters that will be installed as part of the Smart Meter programme. That functionality includes displaying information about the energy(gas and electricity) usage such as: 
          <ul>
            <li>energy usage</li>
            <li>energy cost</li>
            <li>carbon footprint</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Evaluation</h4>
        <p>
          The evaluation will consist of getting to know the application and doing several tasks, followed by a questionnaire.
          Tasks to complete:
          <ol>
            <li>In which month in 2011 most electricity was used?</li>
            <li>Check how much electricity you used on April 13th 2011</li>
            <li>Compare your March 2011 usage to March 2010, which one was higher?</li>
            <li>What time of the day is the carbon intensity lowest?</li>
            <li>What was the carbon footprint of the household for 2010?</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <h4>Questionnaire</h4>
